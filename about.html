                <h1>About NC Personal Fitness </h1>
                <p>NC Personal Fitness was founded by Nolan Conrad in the summer of 2020. Sick and tired of the "cookie cutter" workouts he was doing, he decided there must be a better way. Slowly but surely, he began to perfect building his own workouts, most importantly, with only the equipment he had on hand. Soon thereafter, NC Personal Fitness was born so that Nolan could share his passion for building great custom workouts, with the world.</p>
                <h2> Our Mission:</h2>
                <p>The goal of NC Personal Fitness is to provide the customer with a high quality workout, not only custom tailored to fit their availible equipment, but to meet their personal fitness needs as well. At NC Fitness we want to give everyone the opportunity to get in great shape, and that shouldn't be determined by what equipment you have to work with.</p>
